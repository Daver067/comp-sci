# Recursion

Two projects in here, first project is a fibonacci number generator.
Input a num into fibs(n) and recieve an array of the number of fibonacci numbers indicated by n. Do this as an iterative and recursive function.

Second project is a merge sorting algorithm.

These programs will be run using nodejs.
